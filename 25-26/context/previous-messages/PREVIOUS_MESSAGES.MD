🚨 RUNDISLIGA CUPDATE INCOMING 🚨
🚨CONGRATULATIONS TO CIARAN, RUBEN, GEORGE, JONNY, REYHAN, STEEVE, NICK AND KRIS FOR QUALIFYING FOR THE RUNDISLIGA CUP 24/25 KNOCKOUT ROUND🚨


🚨UNFORTUNATELY, KRIS ENDING ON 16 POINTS MEANS THERE WILL BE NO PLAYOFF 😢 🚨


🚨THAT'S THE MAGIC OF THE PLAOFFS, SO HARD TO PREDICT 🚨


🚨 RUNDISLIGA CUPDATE INCOMING 🚨
[17.01.25, 11:09:26] Tim: 🚨BECAUSE OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF MULTIPLE TEAMS ENDING THE LEAGUE ON THE SAME AMOUNT OF POINTS, INSTEAD OF DECIDING THE TEAMS THAT PROGRESS TO THE KNOCK OUT ROUND ON GOAL DIFFERENCE, THE RUNDISLIGA CUP WILL HAVE A PLAY OFF FOR ALL TEAMS TIED ON THE SAME AMOUNT OF POINTS AS THE 10TH PLACED TEAM. SO ALL TEAMS THAT END ON THE SAME AMOUNT OF POINTS AS THE 10TH PLACED TEAM WILL PLAY EACH OTHER IN A 1 GAME MINI LEAGUE ON GAMEWEEK 28. THE NUMBER OF TEAMS THAT PROGRESS FROM THIS MINI LEAGUE WILL DEPEND ON HOW MANY PLAYERS ARE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE TOP 10. FOR EXAMPLE, IF POSITIONS 7-14 ARE ALL TIED ON 9 POINTS, THESE PLAYERS WILL ALL PLAY EACH OTHER IN A 1 GAME PLAYOFF MINI LEAGUE, THE TOP 4 PLAYERS WILL PROGRESS TO THE KNOCK OUT STAGES WITH THE TOP 6 FROM THE MAIN LEAGEUE 🚨
[17.01.25, 11:12:06] Tim: 🚨 FOR ANOTHER EXAMPLE: IN THE CURRENT LEAGUE TABLE, SINCE POSITIONS 10 - 16 ARE ALL TIED ON 6 POINTS, THESE 7 TEAMS WOULD PLAY EACH OTHER IN A PLAY OFF. SINCE ONLY 1 TEAM IS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE TOP 10, ONLY THE TEAM WITH THE HIGHEST POINTS IN THE PLAYOFF WOULD PROGRESS TO THE NEXT ROUND 🚨
