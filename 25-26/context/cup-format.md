# Rundisliga Cup 25/26 - Format & Schedule

## Overview
- **20 managers** compete

- **Top 8 qualify** for knockout rounds
- **Knockout rounds**: Quarter-finals & Semi-finals are 2-leg ties
- **Final**: Single match on the last gameweek of the season

## Seeding
Before the group stage draw, teams are seeded based on their FPL league position at the end of GW20. The draw ensures varied opposition across the 10 rounds (similar to UEFA Champions League format).

## Qualification
After 10 group rounds:
- **1st - 8th place**: Qualify for Quarter-Finals
- **9th - 20th place**: Eliminated

## Group Stage Scoring
- **Win**: 3 points
- **Draw**: 1 point
- **Loss**: 0 points

Tiebreakers (in order):
1. Points
2. Total FPL points scored across group stage
3. Head-to-head result (if played each other)

## Knockout Tiebreakers
For 2-leg ties:
1. Aggregate score across both legs
2. If tied: Away goals rule (most goals scored away from home)
3. If still tied: Higher GW score in 2nd leg wins

For Final:
1. Single match score
2. If tied: Team with higher overall FPL points that gameweek wins

### PLAYOFF - GW32 (Sat Apr 11, 2026) - If Required

**Playoff Rule**: If multiple teams are tied on points for 8th place (the last qualification spot):
- All teams tied with 8th place enter a playoff during GW32
- **Format**: Highest FPL score that gameweek wins
- All tied teams compete - whoever scores highest in FPL qualifies
- If N spots needed and M teams tied, top N FPL scores from tied teams qualify

**Example**: If positions 7-10 are all tied on 18 points, these 4 teams would compete in the playoff. Since 2 spots are needed (7th and 8th), the 2 teams with the highest FPL scores in GW32 would qualify.
